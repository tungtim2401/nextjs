        With more than 4 years experience as a Front-end developer, I have
        developed Gchats web - the only web connecting all employees in
        Giaohangtietkiem, built & developed 1001 (social media web for GHTK
        customers) & many other projects. My desire is becoming a full-stack
        developer
